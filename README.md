# Introduction
- Age-associated changes in gait characteristics have been interpreted as a more cautious, conservative gait pattern to maintain stability. 
- As walking requires attention, cognitive impairments are likely to contribute to an increased fall risk in the elderly. 

# Aim
- To investigate the relationship between executive function and gait stability in healthy adults to observe normal age related gait patterns.

# Methods
- Sixty seven healthy adults were recruited from the community in two age groups-
young adults (N=34, 18-30 years) and middle-aged adults (N=33, 30-55 years). 
- Walking at self-selected speed with and without performing a verbal dual task were measured with an accelerometer
- Harmonic ratio was the primarily observed gait parameter as an indicator of gait stability.
- It was measured in three axes from the accelerometer - Vertical (VT), Anteroposterior (AP) and Mediolateral (ML).

# Data Analysis
1. Data Wrangling: Import and inspect datasets, Handle missing values and outliers, calculate derived variables.
2. Data Visualization: Q-Q Plot, Histogram, Box and Whisker plots with scattered points
3. Statistical Modeling: Independent sample t test, Pearson correlation.

# Results
- An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare Harmonic ratio (V,ML and H) in young adults and middle-aged adults.
The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in any of the directions: vertical [t(58) = 1.0, p = .3], mediolateral [t(51) = 0.5, p = .6], and anteroposterior [t(61) = 0.8, p = .4].
- Adults exhibited a comparable degree of ‘smoothness’ in their acceleration patterns, as evidenced by the lack of significant differences between the two groups with regard to the harmonic ratio accelerations.

# Conclusion
- The complexity of the secondary cognitive task plays an impact on walking performance. 
- The gait parameter Harmonic Ratio may serve as a sensitive marker for detecting early alterations in conservative gait patterns commonly associated with aging.
